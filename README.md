# diamonds_price_prediction
Build various continuous and classification prediction models to predict the price of the diamonds.  

This project deals with predicting the price of a diamond based on the different features it can have. The change in the price of the diamonds can be tracked using this.
The project has in total 5 models. One of them is a continuous predictive model: Multiple regression model. The other four models are classification models: KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM and Random Forest.
The data set is taken from kaggle.com
More details are mentioned in the report of the project.
